Yet another dotfiles repository
===============================

As the title says, this is just another dotfiles repository. It comes with many cool things you'll discover using it!
(This is my default configuration whenever I switch pc/distro, it's mainly focused on C/C++ development and it comes with the awesome z shell with the suuuper awesome oh-my-zsh plugin)

Install
------------
```
sudo apt-get install git zsh build-essential cmake python-dev exuberant-ctags silversearcher-ag
./install.sh
```
